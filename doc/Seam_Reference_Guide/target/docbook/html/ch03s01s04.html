                The conversation context is a truly central concept in Seam. A <span class="emphasis">
               <em>conversation</em>
            </span> is a
                unit of work from the point of view of the user. It might span several interactions with the user,
                several requests, and several database transactions. But to the user, a conversation solves a single
                problem. For example, "book hotel", "approve contract", "create order" are all conversations. You might
                like to think of a conversation implementing a single "use case" or "user story", but the relationship 
                is not necessarily quite exact.
            </p>
         <p>
                A conversation holds state associated with "what the user is doing now, in this window". A single
                user may have multiple conversations in progress at any point in time, usually in multiple windows. The
                conversation context allows us to ensure that state from the different conversations does not collide
                and cause bugs.
            </p>
         <p>
                It might take you some time to get used to thinking of applications in terms of conversations. But
                once you get used to it, we think you'll love the notion, and never be able to not think in terms of
                conversations again!
            </p>
         <p>
                Some conversations last for just a single request. Conversations that span multiple requests must be
                demarcated using annotations provided by Seam.
            </p>
         <p>
                Some conversations are also <span class="emphasis">
               <em>tasks</em>
            </span>. A task is a conversation that is significant
                in terms of a long-running business process, and has the potential to trigger a business process state
                transition when it is successfully completed. Seam provides a special set of annotations for task
                demarcation.
            </p>
         <p>
                Conversations may be <span class="emphasis">
               <em>nested</em>
            </span>, with one conversation taking place "inside" a wider
                conversation. This is an advanced feature.
            </p>
         <p>
                Usually, conversation state is actually held by Seam in the servlet session between requests. Seam
                implements configurable <span class="emphasis">
               <em>conversation timeout</em>
            </span>, automatically destroying inactive
                conversations, and thus ensuring that the state held by a single user login session does not grow
                without bound if the user abandons conversations.
            </p>
         <p>
                Seam serializes processing of concurrent requests that take place in the same long-running
                conversation context, in the same process.
            </p>
         <p>
                Alternatively, Seam may be configured to keep conversational state in the client browser.
