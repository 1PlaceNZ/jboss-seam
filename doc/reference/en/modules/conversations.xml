    <title>Conversations and workspace management</title>
    
    <para>
        It's time to understand Seam's conversation model in more detail.
    </para>
    
    <para>
        Historically, the notion of a Seam "conversation" came about as
        a merger of three different ideas:
    </para>
    
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            The idea of a <emphasis>workspace</emphasis>, which I 
            encountered in a project for the Victorian government in 
            2002. In this project I was forced to implement workspace 
            management on top of Struts, an experience I pray never
            to repeat.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            The idea of an <emphasis>application transaction</emphasis>
            with optimistic semantics, and the realization that existing
            frameworks based around a stateless architecture could not
            provide effective management of extended persistence contexts.
            (The Hibernate team is truly fed up with copping the blame for
            <literal>LazyInitializationException</literal>s, which are
            not really Hibernate's fault, but rather the fault of the 
            extremely limiting persistence context model supported by 
            stateless architectures such as the Spring framework or the 
            traditional <emphasis>stateless session facade</emphasis> 
            (anti)pattern in J2EE.)
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            The idea of a workflow <emphasis>task</emphasis>.
        </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
    <para>
        By unifying these ideas and providing deep support in the framework, 
        we have a powerful construct that lets us build richer and more efficient 
        applications with less code than before.

        <title>Seam's conversation model</title>
    
    <para>
        The examples we have seen so far make use of a very simple
        conversation model that follows these rules:
    </para>
    
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            There is always a conversation context active during the
            apply request values, process validations, update model values, 
            invoke application and render response phases of the JSF request 
            lifecycle.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            At the end of the restore view phase of the JSF request 
            lifecycle, Seam attempts to restore any previous long-running
            conversation context. If none exists, Seam creates a new
            temporary conversation context.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            When an <literal>@Begin</literal> method is encountered, 
            the temporary conversation context is promoted to a long
            running conversation.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            When an <literal>@End</literal> method is encountered, 
            any long-running conversation context is demoted to a 
            temporary conversation.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            At the end of the render response phase of the JSF request
            lifecycle, Seam stores the contents of a long running
            conversation context or destroys the contents of a temporary
            conversation context.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            Any faces request (a JSF postback) will propagate the 
            conversation context. By default, non-faces requests (GET 
            requests, for example) do not propagate the conversation 
            context, but see below for more information on this.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            If the JSF request lifecycle is foreshortened by a redirect,
            Seam transparently stores and restores the current conversation 
            context&#8212;unless the conversation was already ended via
            <literal>@End(beforeRedirect=true)</literal>.
        </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
        <para>
            Seam transparently propagates the conversation context across JSF postbacks
            and redirects. If you don't do anything special, a <emphasis>non-faces request</emphasis>
            (a GET request for example) will not propagate the conversation context and
            will be processed in a new temporary conversation. This is usually - but not
            always - the desired behavior.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            If you want to propagate a Seam conversation across a non-faces request, you
            need to explicitly code the Seam <emphasis>conversation id</emphasis> as a 
            request parameter:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<a href="main.jsf?conversationId=#{conversation.id}">Continue</a>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            Or, the more JSF-ish:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<h:outputLink value="main.jsf">
    <f:param name="conversationId" value="#{conversation.id}"/>
    <h:outputText value="Continue"/>
</h:outputLink>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            If you use the Seam tag library, this is equivalent:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<h:outputLink value="main.jsf">
    <s:conversationId/>
    <h:outputText value="Continue"/>
</h:outputLink>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            If you wish to disable propagation of the conversation context for a
            postback, a similar trick is used:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<h:commandLink action="main" value="Exit">
    <f:param name="conversationPropagation" value="none"/>
</h:commandLink>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            If you use the Seam tag library, this is equivalent:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<h:commandLink action="main" value="Exit">
    <s:conversationPropagation type="none"/>
</h:commandLink>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Note that disabling conversation context propagation is absolutely not the
            same thing as ending the conversation.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The <literal>conversationPropagation</literal> request parameter, or 
            the <literal>&lt;s:conversationPropagation&gt;</literal> tag may even
            be used to begin and end conversation, or begin a nested 
            conversation.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<h:commandLink action="main" value="Exit">
    <s:conversationPropagation type="end"/>
</h:commandLink>]]></programlisting>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<h:commandLink action="main" value="Select Child">
    <s:conversationPropagation type="nested"/>
</h:commandLink>]]></programlisting>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<h:commandLink action="main" value="Select Hotel">

        This conversation model makes it easy to build applications which
        behave correctly with respect to multi-window operation. For many
        applications, this is all that is needed. Some complex applications
        have either or both of the following additional requirements:
    </para>
    
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            A conversation spans many smaller units of user interaction,
            which execute serially or even concurrently. The smaller
            <emphasis>nested conversations</emphasis> have their own
            isolated set of conversation state, and also have access to
            the state of the outer conversation.

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            The user is able to switch between many conversations
            within the same browser window. This feature is called
            <emphasis>workspace management</emphasis>.

    <section>
        <title>Nested conversations</title>
        
        <para>
            A nested conversation is created by invoking a method marked
            <literal>@Begin(nested=true)</literal> inside the scope of an
            existing conversation. A nested conversation has its own
            conversation context, and also has read-only access to the
            context of the outer conversation. (It can read the outer
            conversation's context variables, but not write to them.)
            When an <literal>@End</literal> is subsequently encountered,
            the nested conversation will be destroyed, and the outer
            conversation will resume, by "popping" the conversation stack.
            Conversations may be nested to any arbitrary depth.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Certain user activity (workspace management, or the back button)
            can cause the outer conversation to be resumed before the inner
            conversation is ended. In this case it is possible to have 
            multiple concurrent nested conversations belonging to the
            same outer conversation. If the outer conversation ends before
            a nested conversation ends, Seam destroys all nested conversation
            contexts along with the outer context.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            A conversation may be thought of as a <emphasis>continuable state</emphasis>.
            Nested conversations allow the application to capture a consistent
            continuable state at various points in a user interaction, thus
            insuring truly correct behavior in the face of backbuttoning and
            workspace management.
        </para>

            TODO: an example to show how a nested conversation prevents bad 
            stuff happening when you backbutton.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Usually, if a component exists in a parent conversation of the 
            current nested conversation, the nested conversation will use
            the same instance. Occasionally, it is useful to have a different
            instance in each nested conversation, so that the component 
            instance that exists in the parent conversation is invisible to
            its child conversations. You can achieve this behavior by 
            annotating the component <literal>@PerNestedConversation</literal>.

        <title>Starting conversations with GET requests</title>
        <para>
            JSF does not define any kind of action listener that is triggered
            when a page is accessed via a non-faces request (for example, a
            HTTP GET request). This can occur if the user bookmarks the page,
            or if we navigate to the page via an <literal>&lt;h:outputLink&gt;</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Sometimes we want to begin a conversation immediately the page is
            accessed. Since there is no JSF action method, we can't solve the problem
            in the usual way, by annotating the action with <literal>@Begin</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            A further problem arises if the page needs some state to be fetched
            into a context variable. We've already seen two ways to solve this 
            problem. If that state is held in a Seam component, we can fetch the 
            state in a <literal>@Create</literal> method. If not, we can define a
            <literal>@Factory</literal> method for the context variable.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            If none of these options works for you, Seam lets you define a
            <emphasis>page action</emphasis> in the <literal>pages.xml</literal>
            file.
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<pages>
    <page view-id="/messageList.jsp" action="#{messageManager.list}"/>
    ...
</pages>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            This action method is called at the beginning of the render response
            phase, any time the page is about to be rendered. If a page action
            returns a non-null outcome, Seam will process any appropriate JSF and
            Seam navigation rules, possibly resulting in a completely different page 
            being rendered.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            If <emphasis>all</emphasis> you want to do before rendering the page
            is begin a conversation, you could use a built-in action method that
            does just that:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<pages>
    <page view-id="/messageList.jsp" action="#{conversation.begin}"/>
    ...
</pages>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Note that you can also call this built-in action from a JSF
            control, and, similarly, you can use 
            <literal>#{conversation.end}</literal> to end conversations.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            If you want more control, to join existing conversations or
            begin a nested conversion, to begin a pageflow or an atomic
            conversation, you should use the 
            <literal>&lt;begin-conversation&gt;</literal> element.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<pages>
    <page view-id="/messageList.jsp">
       <begin-conversation nested="true" pageflow="AddItem"/>
    <page>
    ...
</pages>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            There is also an <literal>&lt;end-conversation&gt;</literal> 
            element.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<pages>
    <page view-id="/home.jsp">
       <end-conversation/>
    <page>
    ...
</pages>]]></programlisting>

            To solve the first problem, we now have five options:

        <para>
            JSF command links always perform a form submission via JavaScript, 
            which breaks the web browser's "open in new window" or "open in new tab"
            feature. In plain JSF, you need to use an <literal>&lt;h:outputLink&gt;</literal>
            if you need this functionality. But there are two major limitations to 
            <literal>&lt;h:outputLink&gt;</literal>.
        </para>
        
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
        <para>
            JSF provides no way to attach an action listener to an

        <para>
            Seam provides the notion of a <emphasis>page action</emphasis> to help 
            solve the first problem, but this does nothing to help us with the second 
            problem. We <emphasis>could</emphasis> work around this by using the
            RESTful approach of passing a request parameter and requerying
            for the selected object on the server side. In some cases&#8212;such as the 
            Seam blog example application&#8212;this is indeed the best approach. The 
            RESTful style supports bookmarking, since it does not require server-side state. 
            In other cases, where we don't care about bookmarks, the use of 
            <literal>@DataModel</literal> and <literal>@DataModelSelection</literal> is 
            just so convenient and transparent!
        </para>
        
        <para>
            To fill in this missing functionality, and to make conversation propagation
            even simpler to manage, Seam provides the <literal>&lt;s:link&gt;</literal>
            JSF tag.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The link may specify just the JSF view id:

        <para>
            Or, it may specify an action method (in which case the action outcome determines
            the page that results):
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<s:link action="#{login.logout}" value="Logout"/>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            If you specify <emphasis>both</emphasis> a JSF view id and an action method, the
            'view' will be used <emphasis>unless</emphasis> the action method returns a
            non-null outcome:

        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<s:link action="#{issueEditor.viewComment}" propagation="nest"/>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            If the link begins a conversation, you can even specify a pageflow to be used:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<s:link action="#{documentEditor.getDocument}" propagation="begin"
        pageflow="EditDocument"/>]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            The <literal>taskInstance</literal> attribute if for use in jBPM task lists:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<s:link action="#{documentApproval.approveOrReject}" taskInstance="#{task}"/>]]></programlisting>

            (See the DVD Store demo application for examples of this.)
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Finally, if you need the "link" to be rendered as a button, use <literal>&lt;s:button&gt;</literal>:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[<s:button action="#{login.logout}" value="Logout"/>]]></programlisting>

        <title>Success messages</title>
        <para>
            It is quite common to display a message to the user indicating 
            success or failure of an action. It is convenient to use a JSF
            <literal>FacesMessage</literal> for this. Unfortunately, a
            successful action often requires a browser redirect, and JSF 
            does not propagate faces messages across redirects. This makes
            it quite difficult to display success messages in plain JSF.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            The built in conversation-scoped Seam component named 
            <literal>facesMessages</literal> solves this problem.
            (You must have the Seam redirect filter installed.)
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[@Name("editDocumentAction")
@Stateless
public class EditDocumentBean implements EditDocument {
    @In EntityManager em;
    @In Document document;
    @In FacesMessages facesMessages;
    
    public String update() {
        em.merge(document);
        facesMessages.add("Document updated");
    }
}]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            Any message added to <literal>facesMessages</literal> is
            used in the very next render response phase for the current
            conversation. This even works when there is no long-running
            conversation since Seam preserves even temporary conversation
            contexts across redirects.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            You can even include JSF EL expressions in a faces message summary:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[facesMessages.add("Document #{document.title} was updated");]]></programlisting>
                
        <para>
            You may display the messages in the usual way, for example:

        <title>Using an "explicit" conversation id</title>
        <para>
            Ordinarily, Seam generates a meaningless unique id for each conversation
            in each session. You can customize the id value when you begin the 
            conversation.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            This feature can be used to customize the conversation id generation
            algorithm like so:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[@Begin(id="#{myConversationIdGenerator.nextId}") 
public void editHotel() { ... }]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Or it can be used to assign a meaningful conversation id:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[@Begin(id="hotel#{hotel.id}") 
public String editHotel() { ... }]]></programlisting>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[@Begin(id="hotel#{hotelsDataModel.rowData.id}") 
public String selectHotel() { ... }]]></programlisting>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[@Begin(id="entry#{params['blogId']}")
public String viewBlogEntry() { ... }]]></programlisting>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[@BeginTask(id="task#{taskInstance.id}") 
public String approveDocument() { ... }]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            Clearly, these example result in the same conversation id every time
            a particular hotel, blog or task is selected. So what happens if a conversation
            with the same conversation id already exists when the new conversation
            begins? Well, Seam detects the existing conversation and redirects
            to that conversation without running the <literal>@Begin</literal> 
            method again. This feature helps control the number of workspaces
            that are created when using workspace management.

        <title>Workspace management</title>
        
        <para>
            Workspace management is the ability to "switch" conversations in
            a single window. Seam makes workspace management completely 
            transparent at the level of the Java code. To enable workspace
            management, all you need to do is:

                (when using JSF or Seam navigation rules) or page node (when using 
                jPDL pageflows). This description text is displayed to the user 
                by the workspace switchers.

            <listitem>

                or facelets fragments in your pages. The standard fragments

                of conversations, or breadcrumbs.

            <para>
                When you use JSF or Seam navigation rules, Seam switches to a

                for that conversation. The descriptive text for the
                workspace is defined in a file called <literal>pages.xml</literal>
                that Seam expects to find in the <literal>WEB-INF</literal>
                directory, right next to <literal>faces-config.xml</literal>:

               Note that if this file is missing, the Seam application will

                When you use a jPDL pageflow definition, Seam switches
                to a conversation by restoring the current jBPM process
                state. This is a more flexible model since it allows the
                same <literal>view-id</literal> to have different
                descriptions depending upon the current 
                <literal>&lt;page&gt;</literal> node. The description

        <para>
            Conversational components have one minor limitation: they cannot be used to hold bindings 
            to JSF components. (We generally prefer not to use this feature of JSF unless absolutely
            necessary, since it creates a hard dependency from application logic to the view.) On a 
            postback request, component bindings are updated during the Restore View phase, 
            before the Seam conversation context has been restored.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            To work around this use an event scoped component to store the component bindings and inject 
            it into the conversation scoped component that requires it.

      <title>Concurrent calls to conversational components</title>
      
      <para>
        A general discussion of concurrent calls to Seam components can be 
        found in <xref linkend="concurrency" />. Here we will discuss 
        the most common situation in which you will encounter concurrency 
        &#8212; accessing conversational components from AJAX requests.
        We're going to discuss the options that a Ajax client library should
        provide to control events originating at the client &#8212; and we'll
        look at the options RichFaces Ajax gives you.
      </para>
    
      <para>
        Conversational components don't allow real concurrent access therefore
        Seam queues each request to process them serially.  This allows each
        request to be executed in a deterministic fashion and the result 
        returned to the client. However, a simple queue isn't that great &#8212;
        firstly, if a method is, for some reason, taking a very long time to
        complete, running over and over again whenever the client generates a
        request is bad (potential for Denial of Service attacks), and secondly,
        AJAX is often to used to provide a quick status update to the user, so
        continuing to run the action after a long time isn't useful. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Therefore Seam queues the action event for a period of time (the 
        concurrent request timeout); if it can't process the event in time, it 
        creates a temporary conversation and prints out a message to the user to
        let them know what's going on.  It's therefore very important not to
        flood the server with AJAX events!
      </para>
      
      <para>
        We can set a sensible default for the concurrent request timeout (in 
        ms) in components.xml:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting><![CDATA[<core:manager concurrent-request-timeout="500" />]]></programlisting>
      
      <para>
        We can also fine tune the concurrent request timeout for a request:
      </para>
       
      <programlisting><![CDATA[public void getTotal() {
   Manager.instance().setConcurrentRequestTimeout(1000);
   return someReallyComplicatedCalculation();
}]]></programlisting>

    <para>
      So far we've discussed synchronous AJAX requests - the client tells the
      server that an event has occur, and then rerenders part of the page based
      on the result. But we could also use asynchronous (poll based) requests 
      &#8212; the client sends an AJAX request to the server, which causes an
      action to be executed asynchronously on the server (so the the response
      to the client is immediate); the client then polls the server for
      updates.  This is useful when you have a long-running action for which it
      is important that every action executes (you don't want some to be 
      dropped as duplicates, or to timeout).
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <emphasis>But how should we design our conversational AJAX application?</emphasis>
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Well first, you need to decide whether you want to use the simpler push-
      style or whether you want to add using a poll-style approach.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      If you go for a synchronous request approach, then you need to make an
      estimate of how long your AJAX request will take to complete - is it much
      shorter than the concurrent request timeout? If not, you probably want to
      alter the concurrent request timeout for this method (as discussed 
      above). Next you probably want a queue on the client side to prevent 
      flooding the server with requests.  If the event occurs often (e.g. a 
      keypress, onblur of input fields) and immediate update of the client is
      not a priority you should set a request delay on the client side. When
      working out your request delay, factor in that the event may also be
      queued on the server side.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Finally, the client library may provide an option to abort unfinished
      duplicate requests in favor of the most recent.  You need to be careful
      with this option as it can lead to flooding of the server with requests
      if the server is not able to abort the unfinished request.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Using a poll-style design requires less fine-tuning.  You just mark your
      action method <literal>@Asynchronous</literal> and decide on a polling
