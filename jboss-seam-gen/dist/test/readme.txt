If you want to run tests using the Eclipse Junit plugin, you'll need to add
these jars to the top of your TestNG classpath. Using the Run Dialog, select the
test class to run, and select these entries from the project tree:

lib/test/*.jar
lib/*.jar

Seam uses Arquillian in its integration testing.
