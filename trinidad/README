This directory contains the Apache Trinidad JSF component set jar's, Ajax4jsf's
Trinidad integration jar (required if you want to use ajax4jsf and Trinidad 
together), the optional Seam-Trinidad integration package and the seamdiscs 
example which shows correct packaging and configuration for using Seam, 
Trinidad, RichFaces, Ajax4jsf, Facelets and EJB3.

The seamdiscs example is a simple example built using seam-gen and the Seam 
Application Framework which allows you to record your favourite albums and 
artists.  It intentionally uses a mix of RichFaces and Trinidad components. 
It also uses the "inplace editing" pattern; the same facelets are used for
editing and display of data (login to edit a disc or artist).

The Seam-Trinidad integration jar provides a DataModel which, when backed
by a Seam Application Framework Query, provides lazy loading of data for
paging, sorting in the Persistence Context and strong row keys.  You can use it
by adding the jboss-seam-trinidad.jar to your WEB-ING/lib - no need to alter
your facelet.  One caveat is that you must ensure the rows property on the
Query is the same as the maxResults property on the Query.

Example

<tr:table value="#{discs.dataModel}" rows="#{discs.maxResults}">
  <tr:column>
     ...
  </tr:column
</tr:table>
