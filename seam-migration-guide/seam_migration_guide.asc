== Maven
Using Apache Maven with Seam 2.3 as the standard build tool.

Maven 2.3 has migrated from Apache Ant to Apache Maven as the standard build tool following the same process as was done with Seam 3.0. Maven as a build tool is a defacto standard build tool in the Java ecosystem. Whether it is a favorite of yours or not, feature-wise the folder organization and dependency management of Maven is standard. The use of <<arquillian,arquillian>> is also arguably simpler to handle using Maven. 

To migrate from the Seam 2.2 setup to 2.3, _ear_ projects will need to be broken up into a maven multimodule project, and _war_ projects will need just be converted to one maven war project. 

== Folder Organization

The following are description on how to organize Seam 2.3 project in the Maven build tool environment.

[[earprojectorganization]]
=== Ear Project Organization

The folder organization of Seam 2.3 in Maven typically consists of one main project, the `pom` project.  The `pom` project in Maven, is the project that doesn't have any source files onto itself but contains the projects that are required for the build. In an ear based project.  Inside of the `pom` ear based project folder contains three subfolders one for the ear project, one for the war project, one for the arquillian (formerly seam test) project, and one for the ejb project.  Given a parent `pom` project called `myproject`, some ideas for the the subfolders would include `myproject-ear`, `myproject-web`, `myproject-test`, and `myproject-ejb`.  You can refer to the examples in the *examples-ee6* folder for some general ideas as to how to create the folder organization for your Seam 2.3 project.  

Taking the folder structure of the *registration* module in the *examples-ee6* folder of the Seam 2.3. distribution.  The <<figure1,registration folder structure>> shown below shows the typical setup.

.Typical ear project structure
[[figure1]]
image::ear_structure.png[Seam 2.3 Ear Setup,scaledwidth="50%",scaledheight="50%"]

The pom.xml in the bottom of the diagram is the parent pom that contains modules for `registration-ear`, `registration-web`, `registration-test`, and `registration-ejb`. It will also contain http://http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Plugin_Management[plugin management] and http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html[dependency management] information for each of the submodules. Inside of each module, there is another child pom that has information on it's own dependencies and plugins. 

==== Ear Module
The ear project submodule will typically contain all ear based configurations with no source files whatsoever.  The module is short, since not much needs to be held within it.  <<figure2, Figure 2>> contains the folder structure of what is contained inside of an ear module.  The `src/main/application/META-INF` will store the configuration files necessary to create an ear file.  Namely the `jboss-deployment-structure.xml` and any `*-ds.xml` iron-jacamar database descriptor file that is required for deployment.

.ear module
[[figure2]]
image::ear_module.png[Ear Module Structure,scaledwidth="50%",scaledheight="50%"]

First a *jboss-deployment-structure.xml* is required.

You can also include now any database descriptor (*-ds.xml) files into your project in the META-INF directory, and they the data source will be deployed automatically when deployed to a JBoss AS 7.1 Application Server.  The structure of the file though has changed. Before the ds.xml file was a simple xml based file, but now is an https://www.jboss.org/ironjacamar[Iron-Jacamar] based file.  Iron-Jacamar is the Jboss' JCA (Java Connector Architecture) project. Below on <<listing2,Listing 2>> is the former datasource in 2.2, and <<listing3,Listing 3>> shows the conversion to Iron Jacamar using the same driver, url, and credentials.

==== Web Module
To convert a web module see <<upgradingweb, Upgrading Web>> 

==== Test Module
The test module will house former SeamTests which will now be upgraded to Arquillian based Seam Tests.  The layout of the test module is simple as seen in <<figure4, Figure 4>>. All tests will be placed in the `src/test/java` folder, all resources that are required either to enhance or override current setting should be placed in the `src/test/resources/` folder.  Placing source files in the `src/main/java` folder is unnecessary, since these integration tests will be using the ear, war, ejb class and jar files in their respective maven projects. A new folder is required for arquillian testing, *arquillian.xml* and should be located in the `src/test/resources-integration` folder.  Though where this file gets placed is up to you, this has become also a convention.

.Test module

For more information on upgrading Seam Tests to Arquillian and setting up Arquillian in your Seam 2.3 project see the <<arquillian, Arquillian>> section further down this document.

=== War Project Organization
If you choose not run Seam 2.3 as an ear, but as a war. A war project typically will include a parent `pom` project as mentioned in <<earprojectorganization, Ear Project Organization>> and a web project that is located inside of the `pom` project with typically the same name of the project but with "-web" extended on the name of the project, see. Though the naming is not mandatory, it has become somewhat of a convention. For an example folder layout, see <<figure5, Figure 5>> for an example folder setup of a war based project.

==== Web Module
To convert a web module see <<upgradingweb, Upgrading Web>> first the come back.  Once done, a *jboss-deployment-descriptor.xml* needs to be added into the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` so that JBoss 7.1 can determine which dependencies to include for your project. For more information about *jboss-deployment-descriptor.xml* see <<jbossdeploymentstructure, JBoss Deployment Structure>> on how to provide Jboss with information about server dependencies. The end result, is a web module that would like the .

== JBoss Deployment Structure
The *jboss-deployment-structure.xml* file contains what resources will be made available by the Jboss 7.1.1 server modules.  In order to investigate what modules are available by your Jboss server navigate to the `modules` directory on whatever server type you will be running. If you are a running a `standalone` server then the modules directory will be located in the `$JBOSS_HOME/server/standalone/modules` directory. If you wish to call up the dependencies so that they are in use for your project, and so that you do not have to package those dependencies select which server libraries should be used in your project. `export` means that the dependencies will be exported, so any module that depends on this module will also get access to the dependency. See https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Class+Loading+in+AS7[Classloading in AS7] for more information jboss-deployment-structure.  <<listing1, Listing1>> shows an example of the jboss-deployment-structure.xml that makes use of system dependencies where export="true" will make them available to any dependency jar and war files within the ear file.

.Listing 1: Sample jboss-deployment-structure.xml

         <module name="org.antlr" export="true"/>
      </dependencies>
   </deployment>
</jboss-deployment-structure> 
----

For full ear projects, the *jboss-deployment-structure.xml* will be located in the `src/main/resources/META-INF` directory of the ear module.  

For web (non-ear) projects, the *jboss-deployment-structure.xml* will be located in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` directory of the war module.  

[[upgradingweb]]
== Upgrading Web Modules
The contents of the web module as shown in <<figure3, Figure 3>> displays a sample layout for the web module that would be located inside of the project parent `pom` module. The organization is straight-forward, even moreso for those who are already familiar with maven. Inside of the web project, the folder `src/main/webapp` would store all the .xhtml, .css, and other web based files, while `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF` would house all web configurations required for deployment.  To succesfully migrate from Seam 2.3 from Seam 2.2, components.xml, faces-config.xml, pages.xml and any addition page files schemas will need to be upgraded.  Finally, all .xhtml files will also need be upgraded by replacing all `<head>`, and `<body>` tags to `<h:head>` and `<h:body>` respectively.

.war module
[[figure3]]
image::war_module.png[Ear Module Structure,scaledwidth="50%",scaledheight="50%"]

In components.xml, the only real change is to upgrade the schemas used within the components to version 2.3.  <<listing4, Listing 4>> and <<listing5, Listing 5>> show the contrast between both files.

*faces-config.xml* has always been essentially a non-player with seam with no continous active configuration whatsoever.  The roles of this file stays the same, but there is two simple items that need to be performed to upgrade it to JSF 2.1 and for it to work with Seam 2.3.  First upgrade the schema from version 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2 to version 2.1 which is the latest JSF version. Next, change the `version` of the faces-config element itself. Lastly, remove the `<view-handler>` element that was once required for JBoss Seam 2.2, as it is no longer required for JBoss Seam 2.3.  <<listing6, Listing 6>> and <<listing7, Listing 7>> shows the upgrade changes.

Upgrading *page.xml* files as well as other files only requires that the schemas be upgraded. <<listing8, Listing 8>> and <<listing9, Listing 9>> shows the upgrade changes.

Finally, all .xhtml files will need to be upgraded to JSF 2.1.  While most of what was done in 1.2 can remain the same, you will be experiencing errors if certain elements are not upgraded.  <<listing10, Listing 10>> and <<listing11, Listing 11>> shows the difference between the same file that has been upgraded.  First, the `<body>` tag is renamed to `<h:body>` in the both the opening tag and the closing tag while `<head>` will need to be converted `<h:head>`.
