Seam 2.1 Migration Guide
========================
Before you get started with Seam 2.1, there are a few things you should be aware
of. This process should not be too painful - if you get stuck, just refer back
to the updated Seam examples.

This migration guide assumes you are using Seam 2.0, if you are migrating from
Seam 1.2, see the seam2migration guide as well.

Testing
-------

SeamTest now boots Seam at the start of each suite, rather than the start of
each class. This is much faster. See the reference manual for how to alter the
default.
