If you want to run tests using the Eclipse TestNG plugin, you'll need to add
these jars to the top of your TestNG classpath.  Using the Run Dialog, select
xml suite to run, and add lib/test/jboss-embedded-all.jar, 
lib/test/hibernate-all.jar, lib/test/thirdparty-all.jar and 
lib/test/jboss-deployers.jar as the first entries in the User classpath.
