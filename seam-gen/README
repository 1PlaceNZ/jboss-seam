NAME
   seam - execute seam code generation. There is a seam.bat(windows) and 
   seam.sh(linux/unix) that make calls to ANT targets for seam project setup 
   and seam source code generation commands. You must have Ant 1.6 and
   jbossAS with EJB3 installed.
     
SYNOPSIS
   seam [COMMAND] [PROJECT NAME] [OPTIONS]...
	    
SEAM PROJECT SETUP/DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS
   set-properties
      Set various seam-gen properties in build.properties. This task
      sets the various source code packages, target directories
      and jboss home. You can hand edit build.properties. There is support
      for generating eclipse WTP compliant EAR, JAR, WAR projects.
      If you select 'Y' for WTP, then some build tasks, like "compile",
      "build", "deploy" will not work.
	   
      Example: seam set-properties
	     
   new-project
      Create a new seam project that has all dependencies and minimal
      configuration. Refers to build.properties for project attributes.
	     
      Example: seam new-project [PROJECT  NAME]
     
   scaffold-project
      Create a new seam project that has all dependencies and a working
      entity bean, page-flow, BPM and a TestNG example. 
	     
      Example: seam scaffold-project [PROJECTNAME]
      
   deploy-project
      Deploy the project EAR and datasource to JBoss. This command
      will not work if you created a WTP project.
	     
      Example: seam deploy-project [PROJECTNAME]

      Example: seam new-entity [PROJECT NAME] [ENTITY NAME]
