   JBoss AS with EJB3 installed.
     
SYNOPSIS
   seam COMMAND PROJECT_NAME OPTIONS...
	    
SEAM PROJECT SETUP/DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS
   setup
      Set various seam-gen properties in build.properties. This task
      sets the various source code packages, target directories
      and jboss home. You can hand edit build.properties. There is support
      for generating eclipse WTP compliant EAR, JAR, WAR projects.
      If you select 'Y' for WTP, then some build tasks, like "compile",
      "build", "deploy" will not work.
	   
      Example: seam setup
	     
   new-project
      Create a new seam project that has all dependencies and minimal
      configuration. Refers to build.properties for project attributes.
	     
      Example: seam new-project PROJECT_NAME
         
   deploy-project
      Deploy the project EAR and datasource to JBoss. This command
      will not work if you created a WTP project.
