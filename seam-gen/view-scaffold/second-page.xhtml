				<h2>JBoss jBPM</h2>
				<p>JBoss jBPM is a powerful workflow, BPM, orchestration (BPEL) and
				web application pageflow platform that enables the creation of
				business processes that coordinate between people, applications and
				services. Designed for the mass market as well as supporting
				enterprise scale applications, jBPM opens up process automation to a
				much wider market. With its modular architecture, JBoss jBPM
				combines easy development of workflow applications with a flexible
				and scalable process engine. The JBoss jBPM process designer
				graphically represents the business process steps in order to
				facilitate a strong link between the business analyst and the
				technical developer.</p>
