Metawidget Examples
===================

These examples demonstrate the use of the Metawidget user interface builder.
While Metawidget supports many other user interface platforms, only the
Metawidget JSF componenents are being used in these examples.

The reason we are hosting metawidget examples are because the framework
embraces the same declarative style of programming that Seam espouses. Through
the use of annotations, you can control how the user interface is built and
layed out, reducing a lot of boilerplate code that you are used to writing.

You can find information about Metawidget at the project homepage:

Thanks to Richard Kennard for porting the original Seam examples to use the
Metawidget JSF components.

Metawidget version: 0.7
