Seam Hibernate3 Example
=======================
This is a port of the booking example to Hibernate3 with JavaBeans
for the actions. Seam handles the JTA transaction demarcation and
Hibernate session management. This code can run in a J2EE
environment, or in a servlet container with the JBoss Microcontainer
for JTA/JCA support.
