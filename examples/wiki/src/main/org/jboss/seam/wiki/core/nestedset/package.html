    This package contains the infrastructure for a transparent nested set overlay on an adjacency list representation
    of hierarchical data structures.
</p>

<h3>
    The Nested Set approach and background information
</h3>

<p>
    The nested set approach allows extremely scalabe and fast querying of data represented in a hierarchy, a directed
    acyclic graph. On the other hand, a nested set approach has extra cost when the tree is modified, so it's only
    appropriate for read-mostly trees. Consider the following representation of hierarchical data:
</p>
<pre>
      A
     / \
    B   C
       / \
      D   E
     /\
    F  G
</pre>

<p>
    (Note: This particular graph is a binary tree, however, it doesn't have to be binary or balanced.)
</p>

<p>
    This is traditionally implemented with an adjacency list in a SQL DBMS:
</p>

<pre>
    NODE
    ---------------
    | ID | PARENT |
    ---------------
    | A  | NULL   |
    | B  | A      |
    | C  | A      |
    | D  | C      |
    | E  | C      |
    | F  | D      |
    | G  | D      |
    ---------------
</pre>

<p>
    You can now query for the whole subtree of node <tt>C</tt> (or any other node) - this is called a
    <i>bill of materials explosion</i> - with the following strategies:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
        <b>Manual Recursion</b>: Select all the children of node <tt>C</tt>, and if these nodes have children, recursively
        query until the whole subtree is loaded. This can be implemented with a stored procedure in SQL or by
        recursively exeucting <tt>SELECT</tt> statements in the application language. This strategy does not scale.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        <b>Proprietary Recursion:</b> Oracle offers a <tt>CONNECT BY ... PRIOR</tt> extension to standard SQL that executes
        a recursive query inside the database, so you only have to execute one <tt>SELECT</tt> in the application language.
        This extension is proprietary to Oracle DBMS and has several flaws (conceptually), as documented here:
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Issues-Database-Management-Practitioner/dp/0201485559">Practical Issues in
        Database Management: A Reference for the Thinking Practitioner by Fabian Pascal</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        <b>Standardized Recursion:</b> The SQL:1999 standard allows a recursive <tt>SELECT</tt> syntax using the
        <tt>WITH</tt> clause (subquery factoring). This however also has numerous flaws (see the Pascal book) and
        is not implemented by many SQL DBMSs. Furthermore, the implementation is often suboptimal,
        with global temporary tables. As a stopgap measure, please remind your SQL DBMS vendor to implement it
        (or a proper explode() operator as explained by Pascal), so that workarounds like the nested set or materialized
        paths are no longer needed.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        <b>Materialized Path:</b> An additional column named <tt>PATH</tt> is added to the table and the values
        are concatenated strings such as <tt>/A/C/D</tt> for the tuple <tt>(F, D)</tt>. This path value has to be manipulated
        whenever a node is added, deleted, or moved in the tree. You can query for a subtree by using string operations
        such as <tt>where NODES.PATH like "/A/C/%"</tt>, which would return all children of <tt>C</tt>. The performance
        depends on the query optimizer and index usage for such an operation. The cost of each tree modification is
        high, although, it can be implemented with stored procedures in the DBMS.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        <b>Nested Set</b>: A nested set approach is often the most flexible and portable strategy.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Consider the following addition of <tt>LEFT</tt> and <tt>RIGHT</tt> values to each node:
</p>

<pre>
    NODE
    ------------------------------
    | ID | PARENT | LEFT | RIGHT |
    ------------------------------
    | A  | NULL   |  1   |   14  |
    | B  | A      |  2   |    3  |
    | C  | A      |  4   |   13  |
    | D  | C      |  5   |   10  |
    | E  | C      |  11  |   12  |
    | F  | D      |  6   |    7  |
    | G  | D      |  8   |    9  |
    ------------------------------
</pre>

<p>
    These values have been created by traversing the tree from top-down from left to right. You can now query for all
    children of <tt>C</tt> as follows:
</p>

<pre>
    select
      count(n1.ID) as NODE_LEVEL,
      n1.ID
    from
      NODE n1, NODE n2
    where
      n1.LEFT between n2.LEFT and n2.RIGHT
      and
      n2.LEFT => 4 and n2.RIGHT &lt;=13
    group by
      n1.ID
    order by
      n1.LEFT
</pre>

<p>
    Which returns the following result:
</p>

<pre>
    RESULT
    -------------------
    | NODE_LEVEL | ID |
    -------------------
    |     1      | C  |
    |     2      | D  |
    |     3      | F  |
    |     3      | G  |
    |     2      | E  |
    -------------------
</pre>

<p>
    The disadvantage of the nested set model is the high cost of tree modifications, which require, depending on the
    actual data, significant recalculation of left/right values of nodes. This is where the Hibernate implementation
    in this package comes into the picture, it can transparently renumber a nested set tree when you modify your
    parent/child relationships in Java application code, and it can support you when you query for whole subtrees.
</p>

<p>
    (Note: The <tt>PARENT</tt> column of the adjacency list is no longer needed if you have the <tt>LEFT</tt> and
    <tt>RIGHT</tt> values of each node - which can also be used to identify the parent of each node. However, the
    following examples and the implementation in this package assumes that you keep this column intact and that
    you use it for non-nested traversal "up the tree". In other words, this implementation is an overlay
    on the adjacency list structure with nested set tree traversal and queries.)
</p>

<h3>
    The Hibernate implementation
</h3>

<p>
    Assuming that you have an existing adjacency list implementation with a typical parent/child relationship
    represented with associations in Java:
</p>

<pre>
    &#064;Entity
    &#064;Table("NODE")
    class Item {

        &#064;Id &#064;GeneratedValue
        &#064;Column(name = "ID")
        private Long id;

        &#064;ManyToOne
        &#064;JoinColumn(name = "PARENT")
        private Item parent;

        &#064;OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent")
        private Set&lt;Item> children;

        // Constructor, getters and setters
        ...
    }
</pre>

<p>
    You can now overlay a nested set by either implementing the {@link NestedSetNode} interface or by extending
    the default implementation, {@link AbstractNestedSetNode}:
</p>

<pre>
    &#064;Entity
    &#064;Table("NODE")
    class Item extends AbstractNestedSetNode&lt;Item> {

        &#064;Id &#064;GeneratedValue
        &#064;Column(name = "ID")
        private Long id;

        &#064;ManyToOne
        &#064;JoinColumn(name = "PARENT")
        private Item parent;

        &#064;OneToMany(mappedBy = "parent", cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
        &#064;org.hibernate.annotations.OnDelete(action = org.hibernate.annotations.OnDeleteAction.CASCADE)
        private Set&lt;Item> children;

        // Constructor, getters and setters
        ...
    }
</pre>

<p>
    This is a mapped and persistent superclass, so additional columns are either created or required on the <tt>NODE</tt>
    table, their default names are <tt>NS_THREAD</tt> (identifies a particular tree), <tt>NS_LEFT</tt>, and
    <tt>NS_RIGHT</tt>. You can override using the JPA <tt>@AttributeOverrides</tt> annotation on the <tt>Item</tt> entity
    class.
</p>

<p>
    It is recommended that you enable <tt>ON DELETE CASCADE</tt> as a foreign key option on the join column of the
    adjacency list. With this option, you can easily delete a node in the tree and have the guarantee that all its
    children are deleted as well (note that this might conflict with in-memory state if you continue using the
    persistence context after deletion or if you have the second-level cache enabled).
</p>
<p>
    Enabling cascading persistence on the collection of children is also recommended. If you do not enable it, you need to call
    <tt>entityManager.persist(item)</tt> in the right order, e.g.: You need to call persist(A) before you
    call persist(B) and persist(C) if B and C are children of A. In any case, the order in which B and C are inserted is
    undefined, this is a Set in the example - and it doesn't matter. However, parents need to be inserted before children.
</p>

<p>
    The tree is manipulated through the <tt>parent</tt> property and <tt>children</tt> collection of each node. Remember
    to always set both references if you link a node to a parent, which is what the default implementations
    <tt>addChild()</tt> and <tt>removeChild()</tt> of {@link AbstractNestedSetNode} can do for you. If you want to
    save a new item, create it, link it to its parent with <tt>addChild()</tt>, persist it with the
    <tt>EntityManager</tt> and flush the persistence context.
    If you want to remove an item from the tree, unlink it with <tt>removeChild()</tt> from its parent, remove it
    with the <tt>EntityManager</tt>, then flush the persistence context. The nested set tree is automatically
    updated by the event listeners in this package, which you have to add to your Hibernate configuration, here
    for JPA with <tt>persistence.xml</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;persistence-unit ...>
        ...
        &lt;properties>
            &lt;property name="hibernate.ejb.event.post-insert"
                      value="nestedset.NestedSetPostInsertEventListener"/>
            &lt;property name="hibernate.ejb.event.post-delete"
                      value="nestedset.NestedSetPostDeleteEventListener"/>

        &lt;/properties>
    &lt;/persistence-unit>
</pre>

<p>
    Consult the Hibernate documentation if you want to configure them in a different environment. Note that these
    new listeners <i>extend</i> the Hibernate EntityManager listeners and that all classes require JDK 5.0. You
    can however rewrite the code easily to make it work with plain Hibernate Core in JDK 1.4.
</p>

<p>
    To query for a subtree, use the <tt>NestedSetNodeWrapper</tt> and <tt>NestedSetResultTransformer</tt>
    convenience classes. An example, loading the whole subtree starting at <tt>startNode</tt> (which would
    be an instance of <tt>Item</tt> you have already loaded):
</p>

<pre>
    select
      count(n1.id) as nestedSetNodeLevel,
      n1           as nestedSetNode
    from Item n1, Item n2
    where
      n1.nsThread = :thread and n2.nsThread = :thread
      and n1.nsLeft between n2.nsLeft and n2.nsRight
      and n2.nsLeft > :startLeft and n2.nsRight &lt; :startRight
    group by [allPropertiesOfItem]
    order by n1.nsLeft

    // Now bind the thread, left, and right values of the startNode as query arguments to the parameters


    // This comparator sorts the Items by name!
    Comparator&lt;NestedSetNodeWrapper&lt;Item>> comp =
        new Comparator&lt;NestedSetNodeWrapper&lt;Item>>() {
            public int compare(NestedSetNodeWrapper&lt;Item> o, NestedSetNodeWrapper&lt;Item> o2) {
                // Sort nodes at the same level by name?
                // return o.getWrappedNode().getName().compareTo(o2.getWrappedNode().getName());
            }
        };

    NestedSetNodeWrapper&lt;Item> startNodeWrapper = new NestedSetNodeWrapper&lt;Item>(startNode, comp);
    nestedSetQuery.setResultTransformer( new NestedSetResultTransformer&lt;Item>(startNodeWrapper) );
    nestedSetQuery.list();
</pre>

<p>
    You can now traverse the tree by accessing <tt>startNodeWrapper.getWrappedParent()</tt>,
    <tt>startNodeWrapper.getWrappedChildren()</tt>, <tt>startNodeWrapper.getLevel()</tt>, and
    <tt>startNodeWrapper.getWrappedNode()</tt>. All sub-children are initialized with this single query,
    and the <tt>startNodeWrapper.getWrappedChildrenSorted()</tt> collection is sorted with the
    supplied <tt>Comparator</tt>. Use this comparator for "in-level" sorting of nodes.
</p>

<p>
    Note that moving of nodes between parents is not yet supported by the even listeners. If you remove a node
    from a parent, and add it to another parent, the behavior is undefined.
